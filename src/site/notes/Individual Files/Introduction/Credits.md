Credits are an in-game currency you earn through [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]] and spend on personal [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|advancement]]. Each starting character begins with 100 credits in their account, and this amount fluctuates throughout the game. Oftentimes, you will have invested most of your credits into your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] and your ability to pilot it.

There is no real-life equivalent to credits, but it is purposed that 1 credit unit would warrant mundane currency enough to comfortably live for a year.

Trading credits between [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilots]] is encouraged. Whether it ends with kindness of heart or a narrative favour, is up to you.
