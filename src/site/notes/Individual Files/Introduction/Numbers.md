The system uses dice of various sizes, and corresponding values. A die is signified by a “d” prefix before the number. A value counts for itself. Both ultimately generate some number.

# Dice
A die is a device which generates a random number between 1 and its maximum. It is signified by the "d" prefix, followed up by the maximum number it can generate. When you roll a die, the outcome has an equal chance to be any number between 1 and the maximum.
* Dice range from d1 (which always comes up as one) to d12 (which can result in any number from one to twelve). When dice are rolled, whatever comes up is called a result.

# Values
Values range from 1 to 7. Each value corresponds to a die size according to the table. Seven is usually the maximum value of a base stat.

# Blanks
A blank is the lack of die, or a value of 0. In some cases, it means you simply don’t benefit from something at all. In other cases, a blank in a crucial stat renders the frame virtually inoperable.

# Point Buy
Commonly throughout the system, you will interact with point buy, in which you purchase a value or die with a number of points. The point buy cost of dice and values is set by the table and is universal.

| Cost | Dice | Vals | Test Difficulty    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ------------------ |
| 0    | -    | 0    | -                  |
| 1    | d1   | 1    | Lowest Difficulty  |
| 2    | d2   | 2    | Very easy          |
| 3    | d4   | 3    | Easy               |
| 4    | d6   | 4    | Standard           |
| 5    | d8   | 5    | Hard               |
| 6    | d10  | 6    | Very hard          |
| 7    | d12  | 7    | Highest difficulty |
