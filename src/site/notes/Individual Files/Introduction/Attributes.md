An attribute is a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice or value]] purchased with [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]]. Attributes generally belong to one or more categories. 

An attribute is either a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|die or value]] that modifies what is used in certain tests, or changes statistics. Each attribute does what it says - if it doesn't, the category does.
