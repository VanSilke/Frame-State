A conflict is a localized event on some sort of [map](Map.md) prepared by the handler to provide a challenge for the [player pilots](Entities.md). A conflict almost always features some sort of environmental hazard, or [enemy](Entities.md) worth overcoming. Multiple conflicts can be present during a single [mission](Missions).

A conflict begins when one party initiates hostilities, and ends when everyone on one side of the conflict is either dead or out of commission.
