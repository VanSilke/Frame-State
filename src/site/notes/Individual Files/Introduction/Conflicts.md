A conflict is a localized event on some sort of [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]] prepared by the handler to provide a challenge for the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Entities\|player pilots]]. A conflict almost always features some sort of environmental hazard, or [[Individual Files/Introduction/Entities\|enemy]] worth overcoming. Multiple conflicts can be present during a single [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]].

A conflict begins when one party initiates hostilities, and ends when everyone on one side of the conflict is either dead or out of commission.
