A statistic is a property of yourself or a mech, which is not rolled, but can influence, and be influenced by tests, activities, events and point buys.
* The existence of a statistic confers the existence of points named the same as the statistic. These points can be [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|recovered]] or [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|lost.]]
* A statistic can have a minimum, and a maximum, both of which can [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|improve]] or [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Deterioration\|deteriorate.]] When the amount of statistic points changes, it cannot become lower than the minimum or higher than the maximum. 
* A statistic can have thresholds, which can also improve or deteriorate. When a statistic is higher or lower than the threshold (as specified), some interaction with the game mechanics occurs.
