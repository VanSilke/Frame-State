Whenever you interact with the game world in a manner quantifiable by the in-game mechanics, it becomes a test. A test uses dice and values, opposed by a target number.

# Outcomes
When you make a test, you first 
* When made against a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|mark]], the test returns either [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Success\|success]] or [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Failure\|failure]].
* When made otherwise, the test returns a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|score]]. A test with no [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|mark]] can have [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Opposition\|opposition]] instead.

# Test Structure
A test consists of a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] pool and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]]. Sometimes it is only the dice pool, sometimes only values, other times both. These are based on your piloting skills, your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]], and other modifiers.

A [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] pool consists of all [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] used in the test. When you use a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] pool, roll all related [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]], and keep only the highest result, discarding all others.
- When a rule refers to “adding a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|die]]”, you insert that die into the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] pool. 

[[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|Values]] count for themselves. When you use multiple [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]], sum them together.
* When your test has both [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] pool and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]], add the sum of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]] to the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] pool result. When a rule refers to "adding a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]]", then you include it in calculations.

Specific rules may modify this structure, such as setting an absolute minimum result.
