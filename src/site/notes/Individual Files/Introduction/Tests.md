Whenever you interact with the game world in a manner quantifiable by the in-game mechanics, it becomes a test. A test uses dice and values, opposed by a target number.

# Outcomes
When you make a test, you first 
* When made against a [mark](Mark.md), the test returns either [success](Success.md) or [failure](Failure.md).
* When made otherwise, the test returns a [score](Score.md). A test with no [mark](Mark.md) can have [opposition](Opposition.md) instead.

# Test Structure
A test consists of a [dice](Numbers.md) pool and [values](Numbers.md). Sometimes it is only the dice pool, sometimes only values, other times both. These are based on your piloting skills, your [frame](Frame.md) and [weapons](Weapons.md), and other modifiers.

A [dice](Numbers.md) pool consists of all [dice](Numbers.md) used in the test. When you use a [dice](Numbers.md) pool, roll all related [dice](Numbers.md), and keep only the highest result, discarding all others.
- When a rule refers to “adding a [die](Numbers.md)”, you insert that die into the [dice](Numbers.md) pool. 

[Values](Numbers.md) count for themselves. When you use multiple [values](Numbers.md), sum them together.
* When your test has both [dice](Numbers.md) pool and [values](Numbers.md), add the sum of [values](Numbers.md) to the [dice](Numbers.md) pool result. When a rule refers to "adding a [value](Numbers.md)", then you include it in calculations.

Specific rules may modify this structure, such as setting an absolute minimum result.
