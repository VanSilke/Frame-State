A mark is a [number](Numbers.md) you make your [test](Tests.md) against. The presence of a mark indicates that the test results in a [success](Success.md) or [failure](Failure.md), and its absence indicates that the result is a [score](Score.md).

# Draws
If the result equals the [mark](Mark.md), [player pilots](Entities.md) always get a [success](Success.md) and [NPCs](Entities.md) always get a [failure](Failure.md), no matter who initiated the [test](Tests.md).

If two of the same type of [entity](Entities.md) clash, the [entity](Entities.md) currently taking their [turn](Rounds.md) wins on a draw.
