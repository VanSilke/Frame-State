A mark is a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|number]] you make your [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] against. The presence of a mark indicates that the test results in a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Success\|success]] or [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Failure\|failure]], and its absence indicates that the result is a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|score]].

# Draws
If the result equals the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|mark]], [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|player pilots]] always get a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Success\|success]] and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|NPCs]] always get a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Failure\|failure]], no matter who initiated the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]].

If two of the same type of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|entity]] clash, the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|entity]] currently taking their [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]] wins on a draw.
