A score is a variable in which the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] returns some outcome, usually based on the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] rolled and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]] added or subtracted. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Opposition\|Opposition]] directly reduces the score.
