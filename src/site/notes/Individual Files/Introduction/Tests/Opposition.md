A mark is a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|number]] you make your [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] against when there is no [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|mark]] present. An opposition directly reduces the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|score]], possibly down to zero.
