When designing an NPC, focus on individual tests and statistics. 

An NPC is designed entirely separately from a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]], but uses similar rules otherwise - an NPC needs to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|target]] with its weapons, [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evades]] hostile attacks if it is able, and is subject to [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]] rules. Generally, whenever a rule refers to "you" or a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]], it can also apply to an NPC.
* The NPC has a differing base point buy relative to its category. This point buy can be adjusted ([[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|handler's]] choice) during the design process, but it should be reflected during [[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|mission design]].
* NPC entities are built with [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]], additively, instead of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]]. 

| NPC Category | Base Points | Weapon Points | Weapon Limit | Skill Points |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| SCV          | 5           | 5             | 5            | None         |
| LAD          | 10          | 10            | 6            | None         |
| HES          | 15          | 15            | 7            | 8            |
| Frame        | 20+         | 20+           | 8+           | 8+           |

**SCV**, or a Standard Combat Vehicle, is a typical armed machine used for warfare - the likes of tanks and attack helicopters. Compared to some other mechanized instruments of war, SCVs move too slowly or predictably to pose difficulty for any advanced targeting system. Further, a single square hit will destroy most SCVs.
* SCV has 3 base [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]].
* SCV cannot [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]]. All [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]] against a SCV are hits.
* SCV has no [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]] or [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Kits\|kits]], and cannot increase these [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]].
* SCV has one [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] of note.

**LAD**, or a Low-touch Autonomous Drone, is an autonomous machine. It features on-board artificial intelligence capable of making rudimentary decisions and following basic attack patterns. 
* LAD has 6 base [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]].
* LAD has no [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Kits\|kits]], and cannot increase this [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]].
* LAD has no [[Individual Files/Chargen/Skills\|pilot skills]] and cannot increase them.
* LAD has one [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] of note.

A **HES**, or a High-touch Enhancement System, is a human-piloted advanced machine only a step below [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frames]].
* HES can have up to two [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] of note.

A **frame**, which is not an acronym, is a machine that melds human skill with extraordinary military technology. It is usually humanoid, but other shapes also exist. Since each frame is mostly unique with very few examples of mass production, an encounter with hostile frames should be dangerous and memorable if possible.
