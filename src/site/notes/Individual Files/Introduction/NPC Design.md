When designing an NPC, focus on individual tests and statistics. 

An NPC is designed entirely separately from a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]], but uses similar rules otherwise - an NPC needs to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|target]] with its weapons, [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evades]] hostile attacks if it is able, and is subject to [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]] rules. Generally, whenever a rule refers to "you" or a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]], it can also apply to an NPC.
* The NPC has a differing base point buy relative to its category. This point buy can be adjusted ([[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|handler's]] choice) during the design process, but it should be reflected during [[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|mission design]].
* NPC [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|units]] are built with [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]], additively, instead of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]]. 

| NPC Category | Tuning | Weapons | Wpn Limit | Skill | Modules |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| SCV | 5 | 5 | 5 | None | None |
| LAD | 10 | 10 | 6 | None | 1 |
| HES | 15 | 15 | 7 | 8 | 2 |
| Frame | 20+ | 20+ | 8+ | 8+ | 4 |

**SCV**, or a Standard Combat Vehicle, is a typical armed machine used for warfare - the likes of tanks and attack helicopters. Compared to some other mechanized instruments of war, SCVs move too slowly or predictably to pose difficulty for any advanced targeting system. Further, a single square hit will destroy most SCVs.
* SCV has 3 base [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]].
* SCV cannot [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]]. All [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]] against a SCV are hits.
* SCV has no [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]] or [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Kits\|kits]], and cannot increase these [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]].
* SCV has one [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|mounted weapon]] of note.
* SCV has no [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion modules]].

**LAD**, or a Low-touch Autonomous Drone, is an autonomous machine. It features on-board artificial intelligence capable of making rudimentary decisions and following basic attack patterns. 
* LAD has 6 base [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]].
* LAD has no [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Kits\|kits]], and cannot increase this [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]].
* LAD has no [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|pilot skills]] and cannot increase them.
* LAD has one [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] of note.
* LAD has one [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion module]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|point]].

A **HES**, or a High-touch Enhancement System, is a human-piloted advanced machine only a step below [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frames]].
* HES can have up to two [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] of note.
* HES has two [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion module]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]].

A **frame**, which is not an acronym, is a machine that melds human skill with extraordinary military technology. It is usually humanoid, but other shapes also exist. Since each frame is mostly unique with very few examples of mass production, an encounter with hostile frames should be dangerous and memorable if possible.


# Values Instead of Dice
NPCs make heavy use of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]] instead of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]]. When building an NPC, use the below table.

Keep always in mind, that a single [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]] has a cap of 7. This means, that [[Individual Files/Introduction/Attributes\|attributes]] of 8 or higher require investing in two [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]], much like a player pilot would. The maximum [[Individual Files/Introduction/Attributes\|attribute]] achievable during generation is always 10 no matter what.

As a practical example, consider building an enemy [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]]. In order to set up its [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defences]], you tally up the NPC pilot's [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|operation skill]] and specific [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Tuning\|plating tuning]]. If you assign four points toward the relevant skill, and five points into tuning, you will arrive at 9 points total (enough to gain 8). Therefore, the enemy [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] will have a [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defence]] of 8 toward a specific damage type.

| Attribute | Point Cost | Total Points |
| :-------: | :--------: | :----------: |
|     1     |     1      |      1       |
|     2     |     1      |      2       |
|     3     |     1      |      3       |
|     4     |     1      |      4       |
|     5     |     1      |      5       |
|     6     |     1      |      6       |
|     7     |     1      |      7       |
|     8     |     2      |      9       |
|     9     |     2      |      11      |
|    10     |     3      |      14      |
