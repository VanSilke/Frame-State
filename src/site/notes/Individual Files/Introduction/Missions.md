You are a frame [pilot](Introduction). By default, you are an independent mercenary accepting missions from the highest bidder, often simultaneously working for opposing sides of the same conflict. As such, the game tends to operate on a mission basis. Each mission has an objective of sorts, set by the employer.

# Payout
Missions have a base payout, offered if you succeed at the primary objective. A mission can have secondary or hidden objectives, which provide bonus pay. On the other hand, your employer may reduce your pay if you mismanage an objective.

# Mission Costs
While on a mission, keep track of each [autofix](Autofix.md) and each [use](Reload.md) of a [weapon](Weapons.md). When the mission concludes, tally up the costs.
* Each [autofix](Autofix.md) costs credits equal to 50 + [points](Points) used in [frame](Frame) [tuning](Tuning).
* Each [weapon](Weapons.md) [use](Use) costs credits equal to [points](Points) used for that [weapon](Weapons.md). If your [weapons](Weapons.md) have uneven [point](Points) distribution, each [weapon](Weapons.md) should be tracked separately.
* Finally, if you don't finish a mission with full [integrity](Integrity.md), you pay one additional [autofix](Autofix.md) fee.

| Mission Cost | Credits                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Autofix      | 50 + Point Cost (of the [frame](Frame))          |
| Weapon Use   | Point Cost (of the individual [weapon](Weapons.md)) |

# Debt
If the costs are too high, you may go into a negative, which reduces your currency instead of adding to it, potentially getting you into debt. Debt is more of a narrative device, since you can still use assembly however you like, but it renders you unable to advance your stats until you go out of the negative and earn usable money.
