You are a frame [[Individual Files/Introduction\|pilot]]. By default, you are an independent mercenary accepting missions from the highest bidder, often simultaneously working for opposing sides of the same conflict. As such, the game tends to operate on a mission basis. Each mission has an objective of sorts, set by the employer.

# Payout
Missions have a base payout, offered if you succeed at the primary objective. A mission can have secondary or hidden objectives, which provide bonus pay. On the other hand, your employer may reduce your pay if you mismanage an objective.

# Mission Costs
While on a mission, keep track of each [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Autofix\|autofix]] and each [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Reload\|use]] of a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]]. When the mission concludes, tally up the costs.
* Each [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Autofix\|autofix]] costs credits equal to 50 + [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] used in [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]].
* Each [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|use]] costs credits equal to [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] used for that [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]]. If your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] have uneven [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|point]] distribution, each [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] should be tracked separately.
* Finally, if you don't finish a mission with full [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]], you pay one additional [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Autofix\|autofix]] fee.

| Mission Cost | Credits                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Autofix      | 50 + Point Cost (of the [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]])             |
| Weapon Use   | Point Cost (of the individual [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]]) |

# Debt
If the costs are too high, you may go into a negative, which reduces your currency instead of adding to it, potentially getting you into debt. Debt is more of a narrative device, since you can still use assembly however you like, but it renders you unable to advance your stats until you go out of the negative and earn usable money.
