FRAME STATE RPG is an attempt to produce a lightweight game about mech warfare. 
* [See Google Sheet for a character sheet (out of date!).](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZKpCgH2fd1nbUWRz3xMhdWFkJTIbK3ZiY1GRk2w310Y/edit?usp=sharing)

The PLAYTEST 1 version features minimal fluff and incomplete mechanics. For one, it features no pre-made [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frames]] or [[Individual Files/Introduction/NPC Design\|NPCs]], although full rules are included for their creation. PLAYTEST 1 also extensively uses an Obsidian vault for organising files, neglecting traditional rulebook structure in the process.

Finally, the author does not warrant that the game will be in any way balanced during any of the PLAYTEST versions. As a result, some artefacts may occur, such as inability to get by with [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|rewards]] by the [[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|minimum tally]] alone.

Current pitfalls, which you must keep in mind when playing: 
* only one official mark test
* absence of "generic" tests like "move this boulder here"
* completely unknown conflict balance

# Players
The game has two kinds of players: any number of Pilots (preferably between 2 and 5) and a [[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|Handler]].

# Being a Pilot
As a Pilot, you operate a mechanical wonder of military technology dubbed a "[[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]]", and interact with the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]] by the Handler. You begin with 100 [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|credits]] and a functioning [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]]. Good luck.

# Being a Handler
The Handler simulates the game world, including [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|NPCs]] both allied and hostile, and the environment on the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]].
