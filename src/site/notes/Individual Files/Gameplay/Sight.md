Line of sight is a narrative concept describing what you can and cannot see. If you cannot draw a relatively straight line from yourself to the point of interest, then it is out of sight. You might still be able to discern that something is there, based on sound, environmental cues, and [survey](Survey.md) [tests](Tests).

Normally, you are unable to [designate](Designate) a point of interest if you cannot see it for any purpose other than to [move](Move.md) or blind fire.

# Blind Firing
If you attempt to [target](Target) a [designation](Designations) which is out of sight and is not [highlighted](Highlighted), the [mark](Mark) against the [targeting](Target) [test](Tests) is always 7 or higher.
