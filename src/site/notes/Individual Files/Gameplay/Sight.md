Line of sight is a narrative concept describing what you can and cannot see. If you cannot draw a relatively straight line from yourself to the point of interest, then it is out of sight. You might still be able to discern that something is there, based on sound, environmental cues, and [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Survey\|survey]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]].

Normally, you are unable to [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Designate\|designate]] a point of interest if you cannot see it for any purpose other than to [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Move\|move]] or blind fire.

# Blind Firing
If you attempt to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|target]] a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] which is out of sight and is not [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|highlighted]], the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|mark]] against the [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] is always 7 or higher.
