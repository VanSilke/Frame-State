Actions are a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]], with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 3. You begin with actions equal to the maximum. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovery.md]] increases actions, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|loss]] reduces them. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|Improving]] raises the maximum actions, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Deterioration\|deterioration]] reduces them.

You always [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|recover]] 3 actions at the beginning of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]]. You can spend them however you like, on any available [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activity]].

When you reach 0 actions, you cannot perform any [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activities]] that require you to lose actions.
