Actions are a [statistic](Statistics.md), with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 3. You begin with actions equal to the maximum. [Recovery](Recovery.md) increases actions, and [loss](Loss.md) reduces them. [Improving](Improvement.md) raises the maximum actions, and [deterioration](Deterioration.md) reduces them.

You always [recover](Recovery.md) 3 actions at the beginning of your [turn](Rounds.md). You can spend them however you like, on any available [activity](Activities.md).

When you reach 0 actions, you cannot perform any [activities](Activities.md) that require you to lose actions.
