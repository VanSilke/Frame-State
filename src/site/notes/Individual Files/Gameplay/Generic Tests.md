You may choose to introduce a generic test whenever an action would have a reasonable chance at causing harm or hampering the mission. Additionally, you can just do it to enhance the tension of the scene. It is also an opportunity to reward the player pilots' mechanical choices with affecting the narrative beyond just shooting things.

When you make a generic test, the handler chooses one [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|skill]] or [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame ability]] and asks you to make a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] against a certain [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|mark]], which varies based on perceived difficulty of the task.

|  Mark  | Difficulty |  Compare  | Overview                                        |
| :----: | :--------: | :-------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  |  Minimal   | d1 (100%) | Almost anyone can do it.                        |
| **3**  | Very Easy  | d4 (50%)  | Requires basic levels of competence.            |
| **5**  |    Easy    | d6 (33%)  | Requires standard competence.                   |
| **7**  |    Hard    | d8 (25%)  | Must be a cut above the rest.                   |
| **9**  | Very Hard  | d10 (20%) | Exceptional training grants a chance.           |
| **11** |  Maximum   | d12 (16%) | The best of the best succeed only occasionally. |
# Circumstances
The [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|marks]] are not set in stone. As a general rule, circumstantial advantages and disadvantages are somewhat important for choosing the right mark.
- When a player pilot has a circumstantial advantage, consider lowering the difficulty by 1. This usually allows someone of worse training to still succeed, albeit only rarely.
- When a player pilot has some disadvantage, consider raising the difficulty by 1. This usually still allows someone of the still training level to succeed, but the success is much less likely.
# Pilot and Frame
A handler needs to consider what is being tested more in a scene - the pilot's own [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|skills]], or the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame's]] abilities.
- When the situation demands personal knowledge, coordination with allies, intrinsic reaction time or operating some machinery with the pilot's own or mechanical hands, you call for a pilot's [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|skill]]. 
- When the situation requires physical strength or agility, it is simple to call for a relevant [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame ability]] instead, since you are almost always inside a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]].
