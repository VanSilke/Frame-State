Falling is a form of forced [vertical movement](Movement.md) which occurs once per [round](Rounds.md) during the [environmental segment](Rounds.md), and applies to any [entities](Entities.md), (and certain hazards like falling boulders) that are eligible for falling, such as when neglecting the need to [fly](Fly.md).

The movement range of falling is 10, meaning you fall 100 metres.

If the vertical movement of falling ends in a [non-air hex](Obstacles.md), you stop falling and [take 10 impact](Offence.md).
