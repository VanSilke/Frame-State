Falling is a form of forced [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|vertical movement]] which occurs once per [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|round]] during the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|environmental segment]], and applies to any [[Individual Files/Introduction/Entities\|entities]], (and certain hazards like falling boulders) that are eligible for falling, such as when neglecting the need to [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Fly\|fly]].

The movement range of falling is 10, meaning you fall 100 metres.

If the vertical movement of falling ends in a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|non-air hex]], you stop falling and [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|take 10 impact]].
