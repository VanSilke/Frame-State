A designation, or a point of interest, is a mechanical device for describing any important [map](Map.md) feature, including yourself, allies, enemies, and [obstacles](Obstacles.md), performed during a [designation](Designate.md) event, usually as part of [activities](Activities.md). A designation always occupies at least one [hex](Map.md). If multiple important things exist within the same hex, [hex](Map.md), choose which one to [designate](Designate.md).

Normally, you can only [designate](Designate) points of interest you can [see](Sight.md).
