Activities are brief (done within the span of a second or two) events you perform during your [turn](Rounds.md) to interact with yourself or the world around you. Activities tend to cost some resource, typically [actions](Actions.md) or [energy](Energy.md), to perform.

Some activities are codified, the rest can be improvised. If you cannot perform an activity when it is called, you cannot perform any of the associated [tests](Tests.md) either, unless told otherwise.
