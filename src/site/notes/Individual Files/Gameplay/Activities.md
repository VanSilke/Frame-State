Activities are brief (done within the span of a second or two) events you perform during your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]] to interact with yourself or the world around you. Activities tend to cost some resource, typically [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|actions]] or [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]], to perform.

Some activities are codified, the rest can be improvised. If you cannot perform an activity when it is called, you cannot perform any of the associated [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]] either, unless told otherwise.
