A terrain hex is free of obstacles. 

Each terrain hex is assigned height. If the height of a terrain hex is at least 10m higher than the height of the hex occupied by you, you cannot enter it with [horizontal movement](Movement.md). 

You don't [fall](Falling.md) below a terrain hex, nor can you [move vertically](Movement.md) below it.
