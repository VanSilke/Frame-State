A terrain hex is free of obstacles. 

Each terrain hex is assigned height. If the height of a terrain hex is at least 10m higher than the height of the hex occupied by you, you cannot enter it with [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|horizontal movement]]. 

You don't [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Falling\|fall]] below a terrain hex, nor can you [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|move vertically]] below it.
