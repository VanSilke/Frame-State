An air hex is a pocket of empty space 10m above the hex below, which can be either another air hex or a different type of hex.

Generally, there is no limit to how many air hexes can be stacked on top of each other, unless the map has some sort of ceiling. It is most commonly used for [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|flying]]. 

When you [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Move\|move]], your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|movement]] automatically ends on the first air hex you enter during the activity, unless you [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|flew]] on your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]].

If you begin your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]] in an air hex, you are required to [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|fly]] through some means, otherwise you begin to [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Falling\|fall]].
