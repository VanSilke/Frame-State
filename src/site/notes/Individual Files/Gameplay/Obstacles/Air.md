An air hex is a pocket of empty space 10m above the hex below, which can be either another air hex or a different type of hex.

Generally, there is no limit to how many air hexes can be stacked on top of each other, unless the map has some sort of ceiling. It is most commonly used for [flying](Fly.md). 

When you [move](Move.md), your [movement](Movement.md) automatically ends on the first air hex you enter during the activity, unless you [flew](Fly.md) on your [turn](Rounds.md).

If you begin your [turn](Rounds.md) in an air hex, you are required to [fly](Fly.md) through some means, otherwise you begin to [fall](Falling.md).
