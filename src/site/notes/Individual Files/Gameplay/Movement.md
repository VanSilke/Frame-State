Movement occurs when you alter your position on the [map](Map.md). You must have a movement range higher than 0 to perform movement, and there are usually ways to obtain it.

In order to perform movement, [designate](Designate.md) choose a hex within your movement [range](Map.md), and advance your position through the hexes until you reach that hex. The path you take can be important, so as to avoid [obstacles](Obstacles.md) and hazards along the way.

Normally, frames and similar large objects are unable to occupy or move into the same hex simultaneously.

# Directional Movement
While movement follows the usual rules for ranges, it is separated into vertical and horizontal.
* On horizontal movement, you move as if the map was "flat". You are unable to move through [obstacles](Obstacles.md) if they are too high.
* On vertical movement, you [designate](Designate.md) a hex directly above or below you. You are unable to move through [obstacles](Obstacles.md) if they are too high.
