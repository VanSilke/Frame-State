When you have a [designation](Designations.md) in sight and want to commence hostilities, you can perform an [attack](Attack.md) [activity](Activities.md) by spending one of your [actions](Actions.md).

When you attack, you use your weapons, as many as you are inclined to, in any order. Using a weapon requires that you select a target. Some weapons discharge immediately on use.
