When you [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Attack\|attack]], you use your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]], as many as you are inclined to, in any order.

Some [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]] immediately on [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|use]].
