Legs are a feature of your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]]. In addition to changing the general look of your frame, [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Legs\|legs]] provide some mechanical benefit, and in rare cases, a detriment.

|   Leg Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|    Bipedal    | A standard bipedal [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] is highly resilient. It can [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Move\|move]] when [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|staggered]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Reverse Joint | A reverse joint [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] can jump. If occupies a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|non-air hex]], it can use any one [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion]] without [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]] cost once per [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|round]]. In addition, you can jump 10 metres of [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|vertical movement]] while [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Move\|moving]], although it cannot count as [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|flight]].                                                                                   |
|   Tetrapod    | A tetrapod [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] can hover in the air. Once you [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|fly]] into an [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|air hex]], you never [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Falling\|fall]] even if you don't [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|fly]] again, unless you are [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|staggered]] - after recovering from [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|stagger]], you must [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|fly]] again or begin to [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Falling\|fall]].                                                                                       |
|     Tank      | A tank [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] is a tank. It improves [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] by 9 and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]] by 3. A tank's [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|horizontal movement]] can only occur in a straight line. Additionally, [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|flight]] has a maximum [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|vertical movement]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|range]] of 10 metres, which overrides every other movement [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|vertical movement]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|range]] you could obtain. |
