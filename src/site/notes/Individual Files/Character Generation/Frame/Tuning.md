Your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] can be tuned extensively, providing bonus [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice and values]], or enabling new things and strategies. Many tuning options [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|improve]] certain [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]] or [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]].
* Creating a frame starts by setting its [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Legs\|legs]].
* You begin with 20 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] to distribute across the frame.
