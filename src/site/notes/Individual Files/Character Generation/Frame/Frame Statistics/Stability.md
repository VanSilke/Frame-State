Stability is a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]], with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 9. You begin with stability equal to the maximum. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovery]] increases stability, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|loss]] reduces it. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|Improving]] raises the maximum stability, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Deterioration\|deterioration]] reduces it.

When you reach 0 stability, you are [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|staggered]].
