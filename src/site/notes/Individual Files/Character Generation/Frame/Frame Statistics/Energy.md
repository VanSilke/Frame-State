Energy is a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]], with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 1. You begin with energy equal to the maximum. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovery.md]] increases energy, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|loss]] reduces it. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|Improving]] raises the maximum energy, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Deterioration\|deterioration]] reduces it. Energy is used for certain activities.

When you reach 0 energy, you cannot perform any [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activities]] that require you to lose energy.
