Range is a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]]. with a minimum of 0 and maximum equal to the base range which varies by [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Type\|weapon type]], multiplied by 1 + the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Tuning\|scanner]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]]. You begin with range equal to the maximum, and it usually stays that way. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovery.md]] increases range, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|loss]] reduces it. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|Improving]] raises the maximum range, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Deterioration\|deterioration]] reduces it.

A weapon's base range is a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|straight range]]. As such, a normal weapon cannot be used through obstacles.
