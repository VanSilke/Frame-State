Multifire is a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]] with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 1. A weapon begins with multifire equal to the maximum. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovery.md]] increases multifire, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|loss]] reduces it. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|Improving]] raises the maximum multifire, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Deterioration\|deterioration]] reduces it.

# Use Cases
If the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon's]] multifire is 2 or higher, when a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] is [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharged]], you choose to do so against the same or multiple [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Designate\|designations]]. In either case, if the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]] makes you you lose [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Recoil\|recoil]], you lose an amount equal to the multifire value.
* When focus firing on a single designation, make as many [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]] as you have multifire, and count the number of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Success\|successes]]. Then, multiply the number of [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] tests by the number of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Success\|successes]] and take the best [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|scores]] for each. This leads to a much higher average. Finally, if focus fire is higher than the enemy [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Type\|shield's]] multifire, [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] from excess [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|hits]] counts against the normal [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Brace\|brace]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defences]] without the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Type\|shield's]] bonuses.
* When multitargeting, [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Designate\|designate]] up to as many points of interest as you have multifire, and make a separate [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] for each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]]. Each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] is subject to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tested]] separately for each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]], but a single point of interest cannot be affected more than once. In fringe cases, such as when an enemy is in range of multiple explosions going off as a result of multitargeting with a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Type\|blast]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]], they take only the highest result.
