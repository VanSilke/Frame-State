**[[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|Targeting:]]** None 
**[[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Statistics/Range\| Base Range:]]** Self Only
**[[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|On Use:]]** [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Activated\|Activate]] 
**[[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Recoil\|Recoil:]]** None
**Property:** Dampening [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(die)]]
Add dampening [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|die]] to the special effects. 
**Special:** The weapon has no offensive potential. Instead, when used, it adds half (round down) of its [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|scores]] to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Brace\|bracing]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defence]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]]. If the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Damage Type\|damage type]] of the shield matches the [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] received, add the full [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|scores]] instead, plus the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|damage property]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]] which comes from the shield's [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Damage Type\| damage type]]. FInally, the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\| weapon's]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Statistics/Multifire\|multifire]] quantifies how many [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|hits]] can be dampened in this way. The shield [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Activated\|deactivates]] after this limit is met, and remaining hits are not dampened.
