**Property:** Radius [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(value)]] 
Whether you [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|hit]] or [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|miss]] the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] during [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]], you generate an explosion in the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation's]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]].
