**[[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|Plating:]]** Wave damage is compared against the lowest of all three plating types.  
**Property:** Resonance [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(value)]]
When you damage a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] during [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]], the [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test's]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Opposition\|opposition]] is reduced by the resonance [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]].
**Special:** Wave weapons are rare, and need to be uncovered, reverse-engineered, or both, as part of downtime. They additionally require a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Tier II/Wave Generator Module\|wave generator module]] on board.
