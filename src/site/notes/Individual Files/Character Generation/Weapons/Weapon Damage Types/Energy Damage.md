**[[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|Plating:]]** Anti-Energy Plating  
**Property:** Cooling [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(value)]]
The cooling value sets cooling points. If you would [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Exhausted\|exhaust]] your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] but the cooling has 1 or more points, you reduce the cooling points by 1 instead. Cooling points reset back to the original value at the beginning of your turn. Cooling is used before the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Type\|magazine]].
