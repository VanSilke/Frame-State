A frame is a mechanical vehicle which you operate as a [[Individual Files/Introduction\|pilot]]. It stands at between 7 to 14 metres tall, although all frames [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|occupy]] exactly one [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]].

# Frame Abilities
The abilities of a frame are divided into three categories. Each category describes a different basic function of a frame, which is used in basic tests.

The die of a frame abiity is d1 when you put your first point into the ability's category, and increases by a die size for every two full points in that category. 

| Frame Ability |        Type         | Description                            |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:| -------------------------------------- |
|   Structure   | [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|Die]] | Structural integrity, strength, power. |
|  Integration  | [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|Die]] | Agility, controls, frame handling.     |
|   Circuits    | [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|Die]] | System and software management.        |

| Points in Category | Ability Die |
|:------------------:|:-----------:|
|         1          |     d1      |
|         2          |     d2      |
|         4          |     d4      |

# Frame Design
The effective design of a frame consists of a body and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]].

The body has a leg type, which both sets its main [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|movement]] and special properties (if any), and simply describes its general shape. The body can be extensively tuned with points between [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]]. 

In addition to [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Legs\|legs]] and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]], a frame is outfitted with up to four [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]]. Each [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] is designed with an individual [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|point maximum]], but all [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] spent on any one weapon draw from the same pool.
