# Advancement
You may use time between [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]] on training and improving your technology, either by personal research, buying up existing parts, or augmentation surgeries. However you explain it, advancement costs the same per category.
* When deciding on advancement, you choose a category and spend some [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|currency]]. When you do so, you gain one point in that category, increasing its maximum permanently. 
* You may advance a single category a finite number of times. After a limit, the advancement in that category halts.
* When you do upgrade your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] in any way, keep track of the total upgrade costs, in case you lose it and need to refit the new one with old parts.

# Experimental Awards
Occasionally, you may come across experimental upgrades, ranging from +1 to +3, inputted as if they were normal points, but without interacting with the point limits. An experimental upgrade adds its value to any result or statistic generated from the attribute it was inserted to, even if the original value is a die.
