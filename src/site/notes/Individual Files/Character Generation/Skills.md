As a [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilot]], you have three main piloting skills. These set the base dice you're going to use for many in-game tests. 
* You begin with 8 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] to distribute among piloting skills.

Each skill has more personal applications, but also involves your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]]. When using skills with your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]], most of the activities are codified.
