**Installation:** Tier II
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]; [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]]

You cover yourself in a defensive pulse layer, with 20 pulse armour points, and [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheat]] in the process. You automatically reduce this point pool by 4 at the beginning of each of your turns.

For as long as the pulse layer is up, you ignore any [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|taken]] and instead of [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defending]] from [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]], you [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|take]] the full [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|score]]. Instead of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|losing]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]], however, you reduce that [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Score\|score]] from your pulse armour points.

If [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] would reduce the armour points to 0 or below, you [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|take]] that [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] as [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]].
