**Installation:** Tier II
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]; [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]]

You generate a semi-stable force field around one of the edges of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]]. It functions as a destructible [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles/Prop\|prop]] with [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defences]] equal to 3. 

Whenever you would have a chance to be [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|harmed]] by something and the line drawn from the origin to your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]] passes through the force barrier's edge, the force barrier is [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeted]] instead. This blocks most contemporary weapons and explosions as long as the barrier is in the way.

The force barrier [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|moves]] with you, always protecting the same [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]] edge, and has a lifetime of 3 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|rounds]] or until destroyed. It does not block [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|sight]], but nothing can pass through.
