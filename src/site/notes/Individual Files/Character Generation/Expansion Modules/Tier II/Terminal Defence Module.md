**Installation:** Tier II
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]];
**Trigger:** You would be [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|destroyed]].

You overload your systems as a last-ditch effort to survive. You set your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] to 1 and cannot [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|lose]] that last point until the end of your next turn.

If you were [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|staggered]], you lose that status.
