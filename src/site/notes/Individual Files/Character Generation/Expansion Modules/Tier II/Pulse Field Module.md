**Installation:** Tier II
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]; [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]]

You generate a semi-stable force field in a [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Designate\|designated]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]]. It functions as a destructible [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles/Prop\|prop]] with [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defences]] equal to 3. 

The force field remains in place for 3 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|rounds]] or until destroyed. It does not block [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|sight]], but nothing can pass through.
