**Installation:** Tier I
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]
**Trigger:** You [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Designate\|designate]] a target for [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|use]].

When multitargeting, [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Designate\|designate]] up to as many points of interest as you have [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Statistics/Multifire\|multifire]], and make a separate [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] for each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]]. Each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] is subject to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tested]] separately for each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]], but a single point of interest cannot be affected more than once. 

In fringe cases, such as when an enemy is in range of multiple explosions going off as a result of multitargeting with a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Type\|blast]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]], they take only the highest result.
