Your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] features enough internal space to hold a passenger. While inside your frame, the passenger is safe from external harm, but shares your fate in case the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] gets [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|destroyed]].

In order to board your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]], you must get it down and open a hatch using one [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]] at the end of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]], and the passenger (who must be in the same [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]]) must spend their whole [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]] climbing into position. You must then spend one [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]] at the beginning of your next turn to close the hatch and return to operational state.

While opened, you cannot [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]].
