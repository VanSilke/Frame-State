**Installation:** Tier I
**Cost:** None
**Trigger:** You would be [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|destroyed]].

Your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] is rigged to explode when you would take critical damage. At the beginning of your next turn, you generate an area of [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Damage Types/Blast Damage\|blast damage]] with d10 [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]], within a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|range]] of 5 centred on your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]]. Additionally, the explosion has Radius 3, generating a secondary burst applied separately.

If you have a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Tier II/Wave Generator Module\|wave generator]], the explosion's [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Damage Type\|damage type]] is switched to [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Damage Types/Wave Damage\|wave]]. Instead of a secondary burst, the explosion has Resonance 3. If you have a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Tier III/Singularity Generator Module\|singularity generator]], the explosion instead has a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Damage Types/Singularity Damage\|singularity type]] with Stability 3.

Unless you have the means of somehow surviving the blast, you die along with the wreck, which becomes irrecoverable.

Finally, you can activate the module on your own by pressing the ominous red button, in which case the destruction occurs at the beginning of your next turn but you can still act to eject or do something else.

# NPCs
The explosion causes 6 points of [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]].
