**Installation:** Tier I
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]; [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]]

You generate a cloud of smoke and chaff in yours and adjacent [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hexes]]. You cannot be [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|highlighted]] for as long as you remain in the cloud. If you were [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|highlighted]], you clear that state. Additionally, each hex of the cloud breaks up [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|line of sight]].

The cloud remains for 3 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|rounds]] dispersing at the beginning of your turn. Exceptionally windy conditions, as determined by the handler, can lower the duration, and a shockwave from [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Damage Types/Blast Damage\|blasts]] clears the cloud immediately.
