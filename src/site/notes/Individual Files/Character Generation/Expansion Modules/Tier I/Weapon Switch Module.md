**Installation:** Tier I
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]; [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]]

You swap one or both of your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|held weapons]] to the [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Holstered\|holstered]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] you are carrying. Your current [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|held weapons]] are [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Holstered\|holstered]] instead.

This module enables you to carry one additional [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] per held slot, of the same [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|point]] cost as the original [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] in the same slot. As such, if you have a 5-point rifle, you can swap it to a 5-point blade. These [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] are [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Holstered\|holstered]] by default.
