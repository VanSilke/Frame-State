**Installation:** Tier I
**Cost:** None
**Trigger:** You are [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|destroyed]].

Your wreck remains somewhat operational. It continues to generate minimal amounts of energy, and uses it to sustain the black box.

While in a black box, you remain impervious to external harm and can survive on life support almost indefinitely, or until you sustain 5 additional points of [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]], treating all [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defences]] as 5. As a drawback, you are unable to eject manually when the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] is [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|destroyed]].

The black box comes with a recorder to memorialise your last moments.
