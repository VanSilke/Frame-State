**Installation:** Tier I
**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]
**Trigger:** You [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]] a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]].

You coat the payload in pulse energy. Add d8 to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]].

When you [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|hit]] a pulse construct, such as that created by [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Tier II/Pulse Armour Module\|pulse armour]], while using a pulse interference module, you make a d4 [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] against a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Mark\|mark]] of 4. If you [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Success\|succeed]], that construct is destroyed regardless of its remaining integrity.

# NPCs
An NPC makes the test regardless in an exceptional case.
