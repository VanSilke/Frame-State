**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]; [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|action]]

You override safety protocols, forcing your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] into overdrive. You [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheat]], but instead of losing the ability to use [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion modules]], you gain the ability to use any [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|module]] at the cost of [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] instead of [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]. In addition, all your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] receive an additional d10 to their [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]]. Finally, you automatically [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|take]] 1 damage at the end of each of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turns]].

You remain in overdrive until you recover from [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheating]].
