**Installation:** Variable
**Cost:** None
**Trigger:** You are about to make a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] to remove [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheat]].

You open your vents wide, expediating the cooling process. As a result, you add a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]] to the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]] made to get out of [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheating]], but reduce all your [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defence]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]] by that [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]] until the beginning of your next turn.

| Tiers | Outcome                           |
| :---: | --------------------------------- |
|   I   | You add 1 to the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]]. |
|  II   | You add 2 to the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]]. |
|  III  | You add 3 to the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]]. |
# NPC
A module installed on an NPC functions differently in relation to how it reduces [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheat]] duration. [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|Defence]] reduction remains the same.
* At Tier I, remove [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheat]] after 4 turns instead of 5.
* At Tier II, remove [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheat]] after 3 turns instead of 5.
* At Tier III, remove [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|overheat]] after 2 turns instead of 5.
