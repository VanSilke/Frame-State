As part of the [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]], you may add a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|die]] to the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]]. You may additionally perform [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|movement]] immediately after the evasion concludes. 

You may dodge unprompted on your turn. While this won't help you evade anything, it still enables the movement. This does not cost [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|actions]] and can be done as long as you have energy to spare.
