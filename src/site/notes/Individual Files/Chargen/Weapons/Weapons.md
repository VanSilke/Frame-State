A weapon is a separately usable [frame](Frame.md) feature, which is usually governed by its own properties based on [damage type](Damage%20Type.md) and [weapon type](Weapon%20Type.md), which set the weapon's unique rules.
* Creating a weapon starts by setting its [damage type](Damage%20Type.md) and [weapon type](Weapon%20Type.md).
* You begin with 20 [points](Points.md) to distribute among all weapons.
* A single weapon can be assigned 8 [points](Points.md).
