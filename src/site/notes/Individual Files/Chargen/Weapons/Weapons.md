A weapon is a separately usable [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] feature, which is usually governed by its own properties based on [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Damage Type\|damage type]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Type\|weapon type]], which set the weapon's unique rules.
* Creating a weapon starts by setting its [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Damage Type\|damage type]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Type\|weapon type]].
* You begin with 20 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] to distribute among all weapons.
* A single weapon can be assigned 8 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]].
