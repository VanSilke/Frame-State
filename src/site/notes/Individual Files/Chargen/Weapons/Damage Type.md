The [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Damage Type\|damage type]] of a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] designates the type of [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Tuning\|plating]] it is matched against during [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|defence]], and provides a special property to it.

| Damage Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Kinetic     | **[[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|Plating:]]** Anti-Kinetic Plating  <br>**Property:** Piercing [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(value)]]  <br>When you [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|hit]] a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] that is unable to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]] with a kinetic [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] during [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]], add the piercing value to [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Energy      | **[[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|Plating:]]** Anti-Energy Plating  <br>**Property:** Cooling [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(value)]]<br>The cooling value sets cooling points. If you would [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Exhausted\|exhaust]] your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] but the cooling has 1 or more points, you reduce the cooling points by 1 instead. Cooling points reset back to the original value at the beginning of your turn. Cooling is used before the [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Type\|magazine]].                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Blast       | **[[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|Plating:]]** Anti-Blast Plating  <br>**Property:** Radius [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(value)]] <br>Whether you [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|hit]] or [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|miss]] the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] during [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]], you generate an explosion in the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation's]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]]. An explosion has a range equal to the radius [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]]. You deal half (round down) of [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] to all points of interest within the explosion [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|range]] including yourself and the initial [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] again. |
| Wave        | **[[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|Plating:]]** Wave damage is compared against the lowest of all three plating types.  <br>**Property:** Resonance [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|(value)]]<br>When you damage a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation]] during [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Discharge\|discharge]], the [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test's]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests/Opposition\|opposition]] is reduced by the resonance [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]].<br>**Special:** Wave weapons are rare, and need to be uncovered, reverse-engineered, or both, as part of downtime.                                                                                                                   |
