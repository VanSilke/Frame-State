The damage type of a [weapon](Weapons.md) designates the type of [plating](Tuning.md) it is matched against during [defence](Defend.md).

| Damage Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Kinetic     | **[Plating:](Tuning.md)** Anti-Kinetic Plating<br>**Property:** Piercing [(value)](Numbers.md)<br>When you [hit](Target.md) a [designation](Designations.md) that is unable to [evade](Evade.md) with a kinetic [weapon](Weapons.md) during [discharge](Discharge.md), add the piercing value to [damage](Damage.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Energy      | **[Plating:](Tuning.md)** Anti-Energy Plating<br>**Property:** Cooling [(value)](Numbers.md)<br>The cooling [value](Numbers.md) sets cooling points. If you would [exhaust](Exhausted.md) your [weapon](Weapons.md) but the cooling has 1 or more points, you reduce the cooling points by 1 instead. Cooling points reset back to the original value at the beginning of your [turn](Rounds.md). Cooling is used before the [magazine](Weapon%20Type.md).                                                                                                                                        |
| Blast       | **[Plating:](Tuning.md)** Anti-Blast Plating<br>**Property:** Radius [(value)](Numbers.md)<br>Whether you [hit](Target.md) or [miss](Target.md) the [designation](Designate.md) during [weapon](Weapons.md) [discharge](Discharge.md), you generate an explosion in the [designation's](Designations) [hex](Map). An explosion has a [range](Map.md) equal to the radius value. You deal half (round down) of [impact](Impact.md) and [damage](Damage.md) to all points of interest within the explosion [range](Map.md) including yourself and the initial [designation](Designations.md) again. |
| Wave        | **[Plating:](Tuning.md)** Wave damage is compared against the lowest of all three [plating](Tuning.md) types.<br>**Property:** Resonance [(value)](Numbers.md)<br>When you [damage](Damage.md) a [designation](Designations.md) during [weapon](Weapons.md) [discharge](Discharge.md), the [damage](Damage.md) [test](Tests.md)'s [opposition](Opposition.md) is reduced by the resonance [value](Numbers.md).<br>**Special:** Wave weapons are rare, and need to be uncovered, reverse-engineered, or both, as part of downtime.                                                                 |
