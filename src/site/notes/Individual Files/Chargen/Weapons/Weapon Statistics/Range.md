Range is a [weapon](Weapons.md) [statistic](Statistics.md). with a minimum of 0 and maximum equal to the base range which varies by [weapon type](Weapon%20Type.md), multiplied by the [scanner](Tuning.md) [value](Numbers.md). You begin with range equal to the maximum, and it usually stays that way. [Recovery](Recovery.md) increases range, and [loss](Loss.md) reduces it. [Improving](Improvement.md) raises the maximum range, and [deterioration](Deterioration.md) reduces it.

A weapon's base range is a [straight range](Map.md). As such, a normal weapon cannot be used through obstacles.
