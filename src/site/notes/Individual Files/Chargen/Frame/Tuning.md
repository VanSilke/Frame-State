Your [frame](Frame) can be tuned extensively, providing bonus [dice and values](Numbers.md), or enabling new things and strategies. Many tuning options [improve](Improvement.md) certain [statistics](Statistics.md) or [tests](Tests.md).
* Creating a frame starts by setting its [legs](Legs.md).
* You begin with 20 [points](Points.md) to distribute across the frame.
