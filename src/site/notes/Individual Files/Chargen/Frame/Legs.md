Legs are a feature of your [frame](Frame.md). In addition to changing the general look of your frame, [legs](Frame) provide some mechanical benefit, and in rare cases, a detriment.

| Leg Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Bipedal       | A standard bipedal frame is highly resilient. It can [move](Move.md) when [staggered](Staggered.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Reverse Joint | A reverse joint frame can jump. If occupies a [non-air hex](Obstacles.md), it can [dodge](Dodge.md) without [energy](Energy.md) energy cost once per [round](Rounds.md). In addition, Dodge can be used for [vertical movement](Movement.md), although it cannot count as [flight](Fly.md).                                                    |
| Tetrapod      | A tetrapod frame can hover in the air. Once you fly into an air hex, you never [fall](Falling.md) even if you don't fly again, unless you are [staggered](Staggered.md) - after recovering from stagger, you must fly again or begin to fall.                                                                                      |
| Tank          | A tank frame is a tank. It [improves](Improvement.md) [integrity](Integrity.md) by 9 and [stability](Stability.md) by 3. A tank's horizontal movement can only occur in a straight line. Additionally, [flight](Fly.md) has a maximum vertical movement range of 10 metres, which overrides every other movement range you could obtain. |
