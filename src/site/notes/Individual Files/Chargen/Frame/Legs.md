Legs are a feature of your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]]. In addition to changing the general look of your frame, [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|legs]] provide some mechanical benefit, and in rare cases, a detriment.

| Leg Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Bipedal       | A standard bipedal frame is highly resilient. It can [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Move\|move]] when [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|staggered]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Reverse Joint | A reverse joint frame can jump. If occupies a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|non-air hex]], it can [[Individual Files/Actions/Energy Additions/Dodge\|dodge]] without [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]] energy cost once per [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|round]]. In addition, Dodge can be used for [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|vertical movement]], although it cannot count as [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Fly\|flight]].                                                    |
| Tetrapod      | A tetrapod frame can hover in the air. Once you fly into an air hex, you never [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Falling\|fall]] even if you don't fly again, unless you are [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|staggered]] - after recovering from stagger, you must fly again or begin to fall.                                                                                      |
| Tank          | A tank frame is a tank. It [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|improves]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]] by 9 and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]] by 3. A tank's horizontal movement can only occur in a straight line. Additionally, [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Fly\|flight]] has a maximum vertical movement range of 10 metres, which overrides every other movement range you could obtain. |
