Energy is a [frame](Frame.md) [statistic](Statistics.md), with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 1. You begin with energy equal to the maximum. [Recovery](Recovery.md) increases energy, and [loss](Loss.md) reduces it. [Improving](Improvement.md) raises the maximum energy, and [deterioration](Deterioration.md) reduces it. Energy is used for certain activities.

When you reach 0 energy, you cannot perform any [activities](Activities.md) that require you to lose energy.
