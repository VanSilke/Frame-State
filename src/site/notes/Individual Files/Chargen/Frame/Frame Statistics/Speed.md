Speed is a [frame](Frame.md) [statistic](Statistics.md). with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 3. You begin with speed equal to the maximum, and it usually stays that way. [Recovery](Recovery.md) increases speed, and [loss](Loss.md) reduces it. [Improving](Improvement.md) raises the maximum speed, and [deterioration](Deterioration.md) reduces it.
