Recoil is a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistic]], with a minimum of 0 and threshold of 1. You begin with 0 recoil. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovery.md]] reduces recoil to 0, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|loss]] increases it. [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Improvement\|Improving]] raises the threshold, and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Deterioration\|deterioration]] reduces it. 

When you exceed the threshold, any subsequently used targeting tests are penalised by recoil - effectively, you add a negative [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|value]] to your targeting tests.

Certain [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] cause recoil loss in specific circumstances. You recover all recoil automatically at the beginning of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]].
