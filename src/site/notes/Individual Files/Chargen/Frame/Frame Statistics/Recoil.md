Recoil is a [frame](Frame.md) [statistic](Statistics.md), with a minimum of 0 and threshold of 1. You begin with 0 recoil. [Recovery](Recovery.md) reduces recoil to 0, and [loss](Loss.md) increases it. [Improving](Improvement.md) raises the threshold, and [deterioration](Deterioration.md) reduces it. 

When you exceed the threshold, any subsequently used targeting tests are penalised by recoil - effectively, you add a negative [value](Numbers.md) to your targeting tests.

Certain [weapons](Weapons.md) cause recoil loss in specific circumstances. You recover all recoil automatically at the beginning of your [turn](Rounds.md).
