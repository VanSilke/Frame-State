Kits are a [frame](Frame.md) [statistic](Statistics.md). with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 3. You begin with kits equal to the maximum. [Recovery](Recovery.md) increases kits, and [loss](Loss.md) reduces them. [Improving](Improvement.md) raises the maximum kits, and [deterioration](Deterioration.md) reduces them.

When you reach 0 kits, you cannot [autofix](Autofix.md).
