Integrity is a [frame](Frame.md) [statistic](Statistics.md), with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 9. You begin with integrity equal to the maximum. [Recovery](Recovery.md) increases integrity, and [loss](Loss.md) reduces it. [Improving](Improvement.md) raises the maximum integrity, and [deterioration](Deterioration.md) reduces it.

When you reach 0 integrity, you are [destroyed](Destroyed.md).
