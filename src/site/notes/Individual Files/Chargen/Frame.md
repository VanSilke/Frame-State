A frame is a mechanical vehicle which you operate as a [[Individual Files/Introduction\|pilot]]. It stands at between 7 to 14 metres tall, although all frames [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|occupy]] exactly one [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]].

# Frame Design
The effective design of a frame consists of a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Legs\|leg type]], which sets its main traversal and special properties, and the frame's body, which simply describes its general shape. Both can be extensively [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Tuning\|tuned]] with [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] between [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]]. 

In addition to [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Legs\|legs]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]], a frame is outfitted with up to four [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]]. Each [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] is designed with an individual [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|point maximum]], but all [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] spent on any one weapon draws from the same pool.
