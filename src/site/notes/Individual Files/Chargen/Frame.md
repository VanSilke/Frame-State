A frame is a mechanical vehicle which you operate as a [pilot](Introduction). It stands at between 7 to 14 metres tall, although all frames [occupy](Obstacles) exactly one [hex](Map).

# Frame Design
The effective design of a frame consists of a [leg type](Legs), which sets its main traversal and special properties, and the frame's body, which simply describes its general shape. Both can be extensively [tuned](Tuning) with [points](Points) between [missions](Missions). 

In addition to [legs](Legs) and [tuning](Tuning), a frame is outfitted with up to four [weapons](Weapons.md). Each [weapon](Weapons.md) is designed with an individual [point maximum](Points), but all [points](Points) spent on any one weapon draws from the same pool.
