When creating a character, you operate within point buy, linearly purchasing [dice and values](Numbers.md) with points at the rate of one increase per point. Each advancement category uses its own point pool. You cannot exchange points between pools.

| Category | Starting Points | Upgrade Cost | Maximum Points |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Frame    | 20              | 300          | 60             |
| Weapons  | 20              | 300          | 30             |
| Training | 8               | 500          | 13             |

Additionally, each individual [weapon](Weapons.md) can have a maximum of 8 points. This is a weapon limit. This too can be increased, up to 13.

| Starting Weapon Limit | Upgrade Cost | Maximum Limit |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 8                     | 500          | 13            |

# Advancement
You may use time between missions on training and improving your technology, either by personal research, buying up existing parts, or augmentation surgeries. However you explain it, advancement costs the same per category.
* When deciding on advancement, you choose a category and spend some currency. When you do so, you gain one point in that category, increasing its maximum permanently. 
* You may advance a single category a finite number of times. After a limit, the advancement in that category halts.
* Occasionally, you may come across experimental category points. These experimental points are added to your category point limit, even beyond the maximum, but cost nothing - instead, they must be awarded in game.
