**Cost:** [Lose](Loss.md) 1 [action](Actions.md); [Lose](Loss.md) 1 [energy](Energy.md)

You perform [movement](Movement.md) with a movement [range](Map.md) equal to your [speed](Speed.md) and render yourself ineligible for [falling](Falling.md) within the [round](Rounds.md) you used it.

The [movement](Movement.md) you perform can be vertical, horizontal, or both.

You may fly without performing movement to simply stay in the air. In this case you [lose](Loss.md) [energy](Energy.md), but don't [lose](Loss.md) [actions](Actions.md).
