**Cost:** [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lose]] 1 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]

As part of the [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|test]], you may add [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|d8]] to the test. You may additionally perform [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|horizontal movement]] with a range of 1.

You may dodge unprompted on your turn. While this won't help you evade anything, it still enables the movement. This does not cost [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Actions\|actions]] and can be done as long as you have energy to spare.
