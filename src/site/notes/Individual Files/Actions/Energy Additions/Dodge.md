**Cost:** [Lose](Loss.md) 1 [energy](Energy.md)

As part of the [evade](Evade.md) [test](Tests.md), you may add [d8](Numbers.md) to the test. You may additionally perform [horizontal movement](Movement.md) with a range of 1.

You may dodge unprompted on your turn. While this won't help you evade anything, it still enables the movement. This does not cost [actions](Actions.md) and can be done as long as you have energy to spare.
