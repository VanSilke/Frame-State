A [weapon](Weapons.md) that can be activated has a specific method of activation, usually when it is [used](Use.md).

An activated [weapon](Weapons.md) performs according to its specifications until the beginning of your [turn](Rounds.md), or until you are [staggered](Staggered.md), whichever comes first, at which point it is deactivated and stops working. Such a [weapon](Weapons.md) needs to be activated again. Certain [weapons](Weapons.md) can be active for longer, or deactivate faster.

When you activate an already activated [weapon](Weapons.md), you choose whether to deactivate it or to have it count as a new activation.
