A [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] that can be activated has a specific method of activation, usually when it is [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|used]].

An activated [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] performs according to its specifications until the beginning of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]], or until you are [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|staggered]], whichever comes first, at which point it is deactivated and stops working. Such a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] needs to be activated again. Certain [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] can be active for longer, or deactivate faster.

When you activate an already activated [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]], you choose whether to deactivate it or to have it count as a new activation.
