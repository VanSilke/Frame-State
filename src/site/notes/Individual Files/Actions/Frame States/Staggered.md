Your controls are overwhelmed, with dire consequences.
* You can't [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]] or [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|take]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] for as long as you are staggered, and until the beginning of your next [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]] after you have stopped being staggered.
* For as long as you are staggered, you cannot take any activities other than to [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Stabilise\|stabilise]].
* If you [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|recover]] 9 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]] or reach [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|maximum]] stability, whichever takes less, you are no longer staggered.
