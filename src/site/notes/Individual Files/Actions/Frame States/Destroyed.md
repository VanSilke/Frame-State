A destroyed [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] is inoperable. As a [[Individual Files/Introduction\|pilot]], you have a choice of dying and making a new character, or ejecting from the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]]. While ejected, you can only rely on your flesh and smarts to fight and travel. This usually means death anyways, such as when you eject in a highly hostile environment.
