A destroyed [frame](Frame.md) is inoperable. As a [pilot](Introduction), you have a choice of dying and making a new character, or ejecting from the [frame](Frame.md). While ejected, you can only rely on your flesh and smarts to fight and travel. This usually means death anyways, such as when you eject in a highly hostile environment.
