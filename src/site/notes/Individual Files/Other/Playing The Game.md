Once you have [[Individual Files/Other/Making A Pilot\|made your character]], it is time to send them on a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]]. Before you sortie, however, it wouldn't hurt to undergo a number of voluntary training exercises.

# Gameplay Loop
The standard gameplay loop consists of [[Introduction\|player pilots]] accepting [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]] from their [[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|handler]]. Each [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]] consists of one or more [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|maps]], and each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]] is composed of one or more [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|conflicts]]. Once a mission is complete, the [[Introduction\|player pilots]] return to their narratively managed base of operations, where they enjoy the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission's]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|bounty]] (reduced by the maintenance costs).

Note that both [[Introduction\|player pilots]] and NPCs are [[Individual Files/Introduction/Entities\|entities]] of sort, and interact with each other similarly, with certain caveats.

# Activities
In order to interact with the game world, you dedicate your resources to performing [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activities]]. 

| Activities    | Brief                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|[Attack]] your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]].                                          |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Repair\|[Autofix]] using a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Kits\|repair kit]].                        |
| [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|[Fly]]                                        |
| [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|[Move]]                                       |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Exhausted\|[Reload]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] to [[Individual Files/Actions/Weapon States/Ready\|ready]] state. |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|[Stabilise]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|recovery]].                        |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|[Stance]] option for ignoring [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Recoil\|recoil]].                      |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Observe\|[Survey]].                                             |

# Tests
Very often, you are required to make [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]], which involve throwing [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|dice]] and tallying up [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]]. This is where your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame's]] design and  [[Individual Files/Other/Making A Pilot\|character choices]] come into play the most.

| Tests        | Brief                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|[Target]].                |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|[Brace]].                            |
| [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|[Correct]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]].                  |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|[Damage]].                          |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|[Defend]].                            |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|[Evade]].                           |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|[Impact]].                               |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|[Observe]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|things of interest]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|[Recharge]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]. Done automatically.    |
| [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|[Repair]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]].                  |

# Traversal
When [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|moving]] through the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]], you use both standard [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Move\|movement]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Fly\|flight]], as well as gain (or are constrained by) traversal options based on your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Legs\|legs]] of choice. Your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|line of sight]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Survey\|surveying]] tests provide an image of the environment. The [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]] is separated into [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hexes]], many of which count as [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|obstacles]], which must be navigated around.
