Once you have [[Individual Files/Other/Making A Pilot\|made your character]], it is time to send them on a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]]. Before you sortie, however, it wouldn't hurt to undergo a number of voluntary training exercises.

# Gameplay Loop
The standard gameplay loop consists of [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilots]] accepting [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]] from their [[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|handler]]. Each [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]] consists of one or more [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|maps]], and each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]] is composed of one or more [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|conflicts]]. Once a mission is complete, the [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilots]] return to their narratively managed base of operations, where they enjoy the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission's]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|bounty]] (reduced by the maintenance costs).

Note that both [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilots]] and NPCs are [[Individual Files/Introduction/Entities\|entities]] of sort, and interact with each other similarly, with certain caveats.

# Activities

In order to interact with the game world, you dedicate your resources to performing [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activities]].

# Tests

Very often, you are required to make tests, which involve throwing dice and tallying up values. This is where your frame's design and character choices come into play the most.

| Tests                     | Brief                                                                                                          |

| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Brace\|Brace]]       | Reduce incoming [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]].                                                                         |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Correct\|Correct]]   | [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recover]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|stability]].                                                          |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|Damage]]     | Lower a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation's]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]].                                        |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|Defend]]     | Reduce incoming [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]].                                                                         |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|Evade]]       | Avoid hostile [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]].                                                                        |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|Impact]]     | Lower a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|designation's]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|integrity]], building up [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|stagger]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Observe\|Observe]]   | [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|Highlight]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Designations\|things of interest]].                                         |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Recharge\|Recharge]] | [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recover]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]]. Done automatically.                                            |

# Traversal
When [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|moving]] through the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]], you use both standard [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Move\|movement]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Fly\|flight]], as well as gain (or are constrained by) traversal options based on your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Legs\|legs]] of choice. Your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|line of sight]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Survey\|surveying]] tests provide an image of the environment. The [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]] is separated into [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hexes]], many of which count as [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|obstacles]], which must be navigated around.
