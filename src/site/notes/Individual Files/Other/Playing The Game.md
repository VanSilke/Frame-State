Once you have [[Individual Files/Other/Making A Pilot\|made your character]], it is time to send them on a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]]. Before you sortie, however, it wouldn't hurt to undergo a number of voluntary training exercises.

# Gameplay Loop
The standard gameplay loop consists of [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilots]] accepting [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]] from their [[Individual Files/Other/Handling\|handler]]. Each [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]] consists of one or more [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|maps]], and each [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]] is composed of one or more [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|conflicts]]. Once a mission is complete, the [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilots]] return to their narratively managed base of operations, where they enjoy the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission's]] [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|bounty]] (reduced by the maintenance costs).
* [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|Examine rules on missions, including payout and fees.]]
* [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|Examine rules on conflicts.]]
* [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|Examine rules on rounds.]]
* [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|Examine entity handling.]]


Note that both [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player pilots]] and NPCs are [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|units]] of sort, and interact with each other similarly, with certain caveats.

# Activities

# Tests

Very often, you are required to make [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]], which involve [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|throwing dice and tallying up values]]. This is where your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame's design]] and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|character choices]] come into play the most.

# Traversal
When [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|moving]] through the [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]], you use both standard [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Move\|movement]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Fly\|flight]], as well as gain (or are constrained by) traversal options based on your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Legs\|legs]] of choice. Your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|line of sight]] and [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Survey\|surveying]] tests provide an image of the environment. The [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|map]] is separated into [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hexes]], many of which count as [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|obstacles]], which must be navigated around.
* [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|Examine rules on maps, ranges and distances.]]
* [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|Examine rules on movement.]]
* [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Obstacles\|Examine rules on obstacles.]]
* [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|Examine rules on lines of sight.]]
