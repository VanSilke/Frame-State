A lot comes into piloting a ten-metre tall war machine. The most important elements of piloting a [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] are described below.

# Frame Statistics
A [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] has numerous base [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]], some of which should be tracked at all times, while others are only used occasionally. A [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame's]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Legs\|legs]] tend to interact with [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|movement]] and its [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]] is added to numerous [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]] and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]] of both the [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] and its [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]].

# Weapons Use
When [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|using]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]], you are required to think, at least to some degree, strategically. You can use all [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] during a single [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Attack\|attack]] activity, but must [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Reload\|reload]] each weapon separately after each [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|use]]. [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Type\|Weapon types]] and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Damage Type\|damage types]] enable different strategies, and [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Statistics/Multifire\|multifire]] adds further [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] options.

| Weapon Statistics | Brief                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Type\|Weapon Type]]   | Sets numerous basic functions and properties.                  |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Defend\|[Damage Type]] and another property.          |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|[Range]] can safely [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|target]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|[Multifire]] enhancement.              |
# Energy Use
You can use [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]] to gain an edge in individual cases. [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|Energy]] can be almost never used, or burn extremely quickly - it is up to the pilot to make a balance.

| Energy Addition | Brief                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Move\|[Boost]] or [[Individual Files/Actions/Token Activities/Fly\|fly]] faster.     |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|[Dodge]] better. Quickly reposition.   |
| [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|[Overclock]] made on your turn. |
# States
Certain interactions cause the [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]] to carry some descriptor.

| State           | Brief                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|Destroyed]]   | Unable to function.                            |
| [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|[Staggered]] or [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|Highlighted]] | Visible to enemies.                            |
