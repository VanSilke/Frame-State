A lot comes into piloting a ten-metre tall war machine. The most important elements of piloting a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] are described below.

# Frame Statistics

A [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] has numerous base [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]], some of which should be tracked at all times, while others are only used occasionally. A [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame's]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Legs\|legs]] tend to interact with [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|movement]] and its [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]] is added to numerous [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]] and [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]] of both the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] and its [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]].

| Frame Statistics | Brief |
|:---:| --- |
| [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|Integrity]] | How much [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|punishment]] a [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] can take before it is [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|destroyed]]. <br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lost]] as a result of [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|taking]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]].  <br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovered]] with [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Autofix\|autofix]] via [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Kits\|repair kits]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Stability\|Stability]] | Prevents [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|stagger]], a dangerous disabling state.  <br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lost]] as a result of [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|taking]] [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]].  <br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovered]] by attitude [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Correct\|correction]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|Energy]] | Allows energy-based [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activities]] and additions.  <br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lost]] as a result of performing these [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activities]] and additions.<br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovered]] automatically, at the start of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Kits\|Kits]] | Allows [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Autofix\|autofix]].  <br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lost]] as a result of performing [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Autofix\|autofix]].<br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovered]] in full between [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Recoil\|Recoil]] | Ability to [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|use]] many [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] in a [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|round]] without penalty.<br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|Lost]] at rates specific per [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] on [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|use]].<br>[[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|Recovered]] in full, at the start of your [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Speed\|Speed]] | Used for [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|movement]].  <br>Static; no [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Loss\|loss]] or [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics/Recovery\|recovery]] occurs naturally. |

# Weapons Use

When [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|using]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]], you are required to think, at least to some degree, strategically. You can use all [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] during a single [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Attack\|attack]] [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|activity]], but must [[Individual Files/Actions/Activities/Reload\|reload]] each [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] separately after each [[Individual Files/Actions/Sub Actions/Use\|use]]. [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Type\|Weapon types]] and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Damage Type\|damage types]] enable different strategies, and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapon Statistics/Multifire\|multifire]] adds further [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Mark Tests/Target\|targeting]] options.

# Energy Use

You can use [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|energy]] to gain an edge in individual cases with the use of [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion modules]]. [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Frame Statistics/Energy\|Energy]] can be almost never utilised, or can be burned extremely quickly - it is up to the pilot to find the right balance for them. 

# States

Certain interactions cause the [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] to carry some descriptor.


|           Frame State           | Brief                                                    |
| :-----------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|   [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|Destroyed]]   | Unable to function.                                      |
|   [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|Staggered]]   | Unable to [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Activities\|act]] or [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Evade\|evade]]. |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|Highlighted]] | [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Sight\|Visible]] to [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|enemies]].          |

# Losing Your Frame
Inevitably, you may face a situation in which you lose your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] in battle or as a result of some mishap. If your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] is [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|destroyed]] on a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]], you must either eject or go down with the collapsing machine. If you die, you must make an entirely new pilot.

When you eject, you remain a vulnerable target as a simple human. You can [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Offence\|take]] only one point of either [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Impact\|impact]] or [[Individual Files/Actions/Tests/Opposition Tests/Damage\|damage]] for you to become inoperable, and action-wise, it takes a whole [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Rounds\|turn]] to [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|traverse]] a single [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|hex]]. If you do survive a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|conflict]] and manage to somehow extract from the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]] area, you can try measuring your options.
- Riding on top of an allied [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] is a bold choice, since any sort of jostle will make you [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Falling\|fall]].

A brand new [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] costs a small fortune of 3,000c. It comes with rudimentary weapons, has to be re-tuned, and retains no [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|point]] upgrades from the previous one (with the exception of your own [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|skills]], since they are not tied to the machine). If you managed to extract the wreck as well, you may refit the new [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]] with the wreck's remaining parts and follow leftover schematics to expediate and cheapen the process of reacquiring your lost power.

Tally up the total upgrade costs which you have spent on purchasing [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] for [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]], [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansions]] and [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]], including individual weapon limits. Divide that total by 10. The result is the amount of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|credits]] you can salvage and reuse to refit the new chassis, with any new arrangement of points.
