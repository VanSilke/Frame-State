In order to make a rudimentary character, you are merely required to attribute a number of [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] across various subdivisions of what makes up a functional mechanized warrior of the future.
* [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|Examine point buy.]]

# Narrative Side
When you begin your career, make sure to assign some amount of background information to your character. This segment of character creation can be as brief, or as extensive as you yourself make it out to be. The richer your pilot's history is, the more attachment you feel with them and their struggles.

# Mechanical Side
Mechanically, your choices improve your [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]] and your likelihood to pass [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]]. You do so by assigning [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] to various [[Individual Files/Introduction/Attributes\|attributes]].

The choices can be made in any order, but a standard creation order can be found in the list below. 

1. Assign your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|skills]]. This describes your human side, and the personal skill you, as a pilot, bring to breathe life into your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame]], as well as indicates how you operate outside of it.
	* You begin with 8 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Skills\|skill]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] to assign.
2. Choose up to four [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]]. This sets your basic playstyle, the things you'd rather do or avoid doing during [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|conflicts]].
	* You begin with 20 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] to assign.
	* Keep in mind, that each [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] has its own 8 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|point]] limit, but all [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] draw from the same [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|point pool]].
	* Keep track of slots in which you install your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] to draw further benefits.
3. Make a choice of your [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame\|frame's]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Legs\|legs]]. This sets your usual [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|traversal]] options and perks, and further enhances your playstyle.
4. Begin [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]] your frame.
	* You begin with 20 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] to assign. These points will accentuate, or make up for your previous choices.
5. Choose [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion modules]].
	* You begin with 4 [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|expansion module]] [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|points]] to install modules with.
	* You automatically acquire the modules you decided to install.
6. Finally, you assign 100 [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|credits]] to your personal account. This is usually not enough to purchase anything new, but it is a good starting point.
