In order to make a rudimentary character, you are merely required to attribute a number of [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] across various subdivisions of what makes up a functional mechanized warrior of the future.
* [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|Examine point buy.]]

# Narrative Side
When you begin your career, make sure to assign some amount of background information to your character. This segment of character creation can be as brief, or as extensive as you yourself make it out to be. The richer your pilot's history is, the more attachment you feel with them and their struggles.

# Mechanical Side
Mechanically, your choices improve your [[Individual Files/Introduction/Statistics\|statistics]] and your likelihood to pass [[Individual Files/Introduction/Tests\|tests]]. The choices can be made in any order, but a standard creation order can be found in the list below.
1. Assign your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Skills\|skills]]. This describes your human side, and the personal skill you, as a pilot, bring to breathe life into your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame]]. 
	* You begin with 8 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Skills\|skill]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] to attribute.
2. Choose up to four [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]]. This sets your basic playstyle, the things you'd rather do or avoid doing during [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|conflicts]].
	* You begin with 20 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] to attribute.
	* Keep in mind, that each [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] has its own 8 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|point]] limit, but all [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapons\|weapon]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] draw from the same [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|point pool]].
3. Make a choice of your [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame\|frame's]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Legs\|legs]]. This sets your usual [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Movement\|traversal]] options and perks, and further enhances your playstyle.
4. Begin [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]] your frame.
	* You begin with 20 [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Tuning\|tuning]] [[Individual Files/Chargen/Points\|points]] to attribute.
5. Finally, you assign 100 [[Individual Files/Introduction/Credits\|credits]] to your personal account.
