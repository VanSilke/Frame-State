In order to make a rudimentary character, you are merely required to attribute a number of [points](Points) across various subdivisions of what makes up a functional mechanized warrior of the future.

# Narrative Side
When you begin your career, make sure to assign some amount of background information to your character. This segment of character creation can be as brief, or as extensive as you yourself make it out to be. The richer your pilot's history is, the more attachment you feel with them and their struggles.

# Mechanical Side
Mechanically, your choices improve your [statistics](Statistics) and your likelihood to pass [tests](Tests). The choices can be made in any order, but a standard creation order can be found in the list below.
1. Assign your [skills](Skills). This describes your human side, and the personal skill you, as a pilot, bring to breathe life into your [frame](Frame). 
	* You begin with 8 [skill](Skills) [points](Points) to attribute.
2. Choose up to four [weapons](Weapons.md). This sets your basic playstyle, the things you'd rather do or avoid doing during [conflicts](Conflicts).
	* You begin with 20 [weapon](Weapons.md) [points](Points) to attribute.
	* Keep in mind, that each [weapon](Weapons.md) has its own 8 [point](Points) limit, but all [weapon](Weapons.md) [points](Points) draw from the same [point pool](Points).
3. Make a choice of your [frame's](Frame) [legs](Legs). This sets your usual [traversal](Movement) options and perks, and further enhances your playstyle.
4. Begin [tuning](Tuning) your frame.
	* You begin with 20 [tuning](Tuning) [points](Points) to attribute.
5. Finally, you assign 100 [credits](Credits) to your personal account.
