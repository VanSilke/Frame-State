You are a handler. Narratively, you are in charge of getting your [[Individual Files/Introduction\|pilots]] in and out of [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]]. As a [[Individual Files/Introduction\|player]] type, you are responsible for running the [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|NPCs]], preparing [[Individual Files/Gameplay/Map\|maps]], and balancing them for a fair challenge, which is sometimes more of an art than science.

You must [[Individual Files/Introduction/NPC Design\|design NPCs]] and place them in a [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|mission]], with a coherent structure. Each [[Individual Files/Introduction/Conflicts\|conflict]] should also be quantified in [[Individual Files/Introduction/NPC Design\|NPC point buy]], to slowly get used to how many points indicate what kind of difficulty.

# Using NPCs
[[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|NPCs]] have “static” dice, using [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|values]] assigned to each [[Individual Files/Introduction/Numbers\|die]]. Thus the highest die (d12) is rolled on the [[Individual Files/Introduction\|Pilot's]] end, but [[Individual Files/Introduction/Units\|NPCs]] always use the result of 7.

Furthermore, when an NPC uses [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Expansion Modules/Expansions\|modules]], you apply the "NPC" effects. [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Overheated\|Overheat]] has a static duration of 5 rounds.

# Mission Rewards
As a handler, you have all the freedom in the world to describe your [[Individual Files/Introduction/Missions\|missions]] to be as difficult and easy as you want, as simple and complicated. Commonly, however, a mission's payout should quantify [[Individual Files/Character Generation/Points\|point buy]] of each [[Individual Files/Introduction/NPC Design\|NPC]] placed on the map, whether the players are meant to fight it, flee, or do something else with it.
