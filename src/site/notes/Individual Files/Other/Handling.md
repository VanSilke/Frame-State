You are a handler. Narratively, you are in charge of getting your [pilots](Introduction) in and out of [missions](Missions.md). As a [player](Introduction) type, you are responsible for running the [NPCs](Entities.md), preparing [maps](Map.md), and balancing them for a fair challenge, which is sometimes more of an art than science.

You must [design NPCs](NPC%20Design) and place them in a [mission](Missions), with a coherent structure. Each [conflict](Conflicts) should also be quantified in [NPC point buy](NPC%20Design), to slowly get used to how many points indicate what kind of difficulty.

# NPC Tests
[NPCs](Entities.md) have “static” dice, using [values](Numbers) assigned to each [die](Numbers). Thus the highest die (d12) is rolled on the [Pilot's](Introduction) end, but [NPCs](Entities.md) always use the result of 7.

Static dice function in reverse - the result is determined by the lowest of all relevant default "dice" from the static pool.

# NPC Energy Use
When an NPC uses [energy](Energy) to [overclock](Overclock) or [dodge](Dodge), normal effects do not apply. Instead, the [test](Tests) result becomes set to a minimum of 5.

# Mission Rewards
As a handler, you have all the freedom in the world to describe your [missions](Missions) to be as difficult and easy as you want, as simple and complicated. Commonly, however, a mission's payout should quantify [point buy](Points) of each [NPC](NPC%20Design) placed on the map, whether the players are meant to fight it, flee, or do something else with it.
