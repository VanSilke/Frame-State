FRAME STATE RPG is an attempt to produce a lightweight game about mech warfare. 

The PLAYTEST #1 version features minimal fluff and incomplete mechanics. For one, it features no pre-made [frames](Frame) or [NPCs](NPC%20Design), although full rules are included for their creation. PLAYTEST #1 also extensively uses an Obsidian vault for organising files, neglecting traditional rulebook structure in the process.

Finally, the author does not warrant that the game will be in any way balanced during any of the PLAYTEST versions. As a result, some artefacts may occur, such as inability to get by with [mission](Missions) [rewards](Credits) by the [minimum tally](Handling.md) alone.

Current pitfalls, which you must keep in mind when playing: 
* only one official mark test
* absence of "generic" tests like "move this boulder here"
* completely unknown conflict balance

# Players
The game has two kinds of players: any number of Pilots (preferably between 2 and 5) and a [Handler](Handling.md).

# Being a Pilot
As a Pilot, you operate a mechanical wonder of military technology dubbed a "[frame](Frame)", and interact with the [mission](Missions) by the Handler. You begin with 100 [credits](Credits) and a functioning [frame](Frame). Good luck.

# Being a Handler
The Handler simulates the game world, including [NPCs](Entities) both allied and hostile, and the environment on the [map](Map).
