A lot comes into piloting a ten-metre tall war machine. The most important elements of piloting a [frame](Frame) are described below.

# Frame Statistics
A [frame](Frame) has numerous base [statistics](Statistics), some of which should be tracked at all times, while others are only used occasionally. A [frame's](Frame) [legs](Legs) tend to interact with [movement](Movement) and its [tuning](Tuning) is added to numerous [statistics](Statistics) and [tests](Tests) of both the [frame](Frame) and its [weapons](Weapons).

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Frame/Frame Statistics/Integrity\|Integrity]]    | How much punishment a [frame](Frame) can take before it is [destroyed](Destroyed).<br>[Lost](Loss) as a result of [taking](Offence) [damage](Damage).<br>[Recovered](Recovery) with [autofix](Autofix.md) via [repair kits](Kits). |

# Weapons Use
When [using](Use) [weapons](Weapons), you are required to think, at least to some degree, strategically. You can use all [weapons](Weapons) during a single [attack](Attack.md) activity, but must [reload](Reload.md) each weapon separately after each [use](Use). [Weapon types](Weapon%20Type) and [damage types](Damage%20Type) enable different strategies, and [multifire](Multifire) adds further [targeting](Target) options.

| Weapon Statistics | Brief                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Type\|Weapon Type]]   | Sets numerous basic functions and properties.                  |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Damage Type\|Damage Type]]   | Sets compared [defence](Defend) and another property.          |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Statistics/Range\|Range]]         | How far out the [weapon](Weapons) can safely [target](Target). |
| [[Individual Files/Chargen/Weapons/Weapon Statistics/Multifire\|Multifire]]     | High accuracy and [offence](Offence) enhancement.              |
# Energy Use
You can use [energy](Energy) to gain an edge in individual cases. [Energy](Energy) can be almost never used, or burn extremely quickly - it is up to the pilot to make a balance.

| Energy Addition | Brief                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Energy Additions/Boost\|Boost]]       | [Move](Move.md) or [fly](Fly.md) faster.     |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Energy Additions/Dodge\|Dodge]]       | [Evade](Evade) better. Quickly reposition.   |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Energy Additions/Overclock\|Overclock]]   | Enhance any [test](Tests) made on your turn. |
# States
Certain interactions cause the [frame](Frame) to carry some descriptor.

| State           | Brief                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Destroyed\|Destroyed]]   | Unable to function.                            |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Staggered\|Staggered]]   | Unable to [act](Activities) or [evade](Evade). |
| [[Individual Files/Actions/Frame States/Highlighted\|Highlighted]] | Visible to enemies.                            |
