FRAME STATE RPG is an attempt to produce a lightweight game about mech warfare.

The PLAYTEST 1.2 version features minimal story and incomplete mechanics. For one, it has no pre-made elements, although full rules for their creation should be included. PLAYTEST 1.2 also extensively uses Obsidian vault for organisation and navigation, neglecting traditional book layout.

Finally, the author does not warrant that the game will be in any way balanced during any of the PLAYTEST versions - certain things may simply be too strong, others too weak.
