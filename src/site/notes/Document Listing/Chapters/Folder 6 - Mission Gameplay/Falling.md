Falling is a form of forced, straight vertical movement, which occurs once per round during the environmental segment. It applies to all units that have the falling state. 
- Player-piloted frames usually fall when they neglected to fly during their turn.
- When falling, the unit moves 100 metres down.
- If during this movement the unit encounters a non-air hex, and the fall was longer than 10 metres, then the unit stops falling and takes 10 impact.
