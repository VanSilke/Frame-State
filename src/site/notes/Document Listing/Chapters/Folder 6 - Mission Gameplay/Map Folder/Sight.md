Line of sight is a narrative concept describing what someone can and cannot see. If you cannot draw a relatively straight line from yourself to the point of interest, then it is out of your sight. You might still be able to discern that something is there, based on sound, environmental cues, and certain tests.
- Certain effects provide a highlight. This allows a pilot to maintain sight on the affected target even if no straight line of sight exists.
