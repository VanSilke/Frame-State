Mechanically, the frame consists of numerous statistics tied to its different parts.
- A frame statistic is a property of a frame, which can influence tests and other aspects of the game. It is usually a value, but can have dice in it.
- If the statistic has a die, it is rerolled every time the statistic is called for. For example, if the weapon has a die in its damage statistic, that die is rerolled every time the weapon damages something, with some exceptions.
- Dice within statistics can ace, adding 2 to the statistic as a modifier.

Sometimes, as specified, a statistic can create a resource pool. A resource pool consists of a  number of points, which can be lost or replenished.

# Minimum Resource Value
The minimum for a resource is always 0. 

At minimum, you cannot spend any more of that resource, and anything that relies on spending the resource automatically fails.

# Maximum Resource Value
The maximum of a resource equals that of the statistic's value. 
For example, if the frame's integrity is 9, then its maximum integrity is 9 points.

# Loss and Replenishment
When you lose a resource, subtract a relevant value from the resource pool.
- Reaching minimum as a result of a loss often has additional effects.

When you replenish a resource, add a relevant value to the resource pool, up to the maximum. 
- Any replenishment in excess of the maximum is lost.

The chassis provides majority of main statistics for the frame.

The frame is nothing without a solid operating system.

The generator provides the statistics for a more optional, but nevertheless highly important element of energy management.

Much like the frame, weapons have their own statistical elements. The statistics are given once for each weapon. Since a frame can have multiple weapons on board, it is important to have each armament described separately.

Furthermore, these basic statistics do not reflect the full extent of a weapon's utility, as most of it comes from the damage type and chosen tags.

| Weapon Statistics | Description                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats/Base Damage\|Base Damage]]   | Default damage of a weapon. |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats/Range\|Range]]         | Default range of a weapon.  |

# Common Conditions
Most common conditions a frame can experience are as follows:

| Condition      | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [[Destroyed\|Destroyed]]  | Unable to act in totality.                  |
| [[Staggered\|Staggered]]  | Unable to act, until un-staggered.          |
| [[Overheated\|Overheated]] | Unable to use actions which require energy. |
