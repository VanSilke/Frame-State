Mechanically, the frame consists of numerous statistics tied to its different parts.
- A frame statistic is a property of a frame, which can influence tests and other aspects of the game. It is usually a value, but can have dice in it.
- If the statistic has a die, it is rerolled every time the statistic is called for. For example, if the weapon has a die in its damage statistic, that die is rerolled every time the weapon damages something, with some exceptions.
- Dice within statistics can ace, adding 2 to the statistic as a modifier.

The statistics are arranged in order of occurrence, from chassis through generators to weapons.

# Resources

Sometimes, as specified, a statistic can create a resource pool. A resource pool consists of a  number of points, which can be lost or replenished.

# Minimum Resource Value
The minimum for a resource is always 0. 

At minimum, you cannot spend any more of that resource, and anything that relies on spending the resource automatically fails.

# Maximum Resource Value
The maximum of a resource equals that of the statistic's value. 
For example, if the frame's integrity is 9, then its maximum integrity is 9 points.

# Loss and Replenishment
When you lose a resource, subtract a relevant value from the resource pool.
- Reaching minimum as a result of a loss often has additional effects.

When you replenish a resource, add a relevant value to the resource pool, up to the maximum. 
- Any replenishment in excess of the maximum is lost.

The chassis provides majority of main statistics for the frame.

The generator provides the statistics for a more optional, but nevertheless highly important element of energy management.

Much like the frame, weapons have their own statistical elements. The statistics are given once for each weapon. Since a frame can have multiple weapons on board, it is important to have each armament described separately.

Furthermore, these basic statistics do not reflect the full extent of a weapon's utility, as most of it comes from the damage type and chosen tags.

| Weapon Statistics | Description |

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats NEW/Targeting\|Targeting]]     |             |
