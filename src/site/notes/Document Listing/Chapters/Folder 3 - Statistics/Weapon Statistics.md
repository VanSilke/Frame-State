Much like the frame, weapons have their own statistical elements. The statistics are given once for each weapon. Since a frame can have multiple weapons on board, it is important to have each armament described separately.

Furthermore, these basic statistics do not reflect the full extent of a weapon's utility, as most of it comes from the damage type and chosen tags.

| Weapon Statistics | Description                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats/Base Damage\|Base Damage]]   | Default damage of a weapon. |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats/Range\|Range]]         | Default range of a weapon.  |
