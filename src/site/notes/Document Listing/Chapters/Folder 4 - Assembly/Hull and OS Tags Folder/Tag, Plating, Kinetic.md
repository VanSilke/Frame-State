The frame is directly more resistant to kinetic damage.

1. Add 2 to mitigation against kinetic damage.
2. Add 3 to mitigation against kinetic damage. Additionally, angled plates protect against direct hits, reducing their damage by 1.
3. Add 4 to mitigation against kinetic damage. Additionally, angled plates protect against direct hits, reducing their damage by 1. Further, you negate 2 damage caused by kinetic impact while staggered.
