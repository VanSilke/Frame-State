The frame is simply bulkier, and therefore capable of taking more hits. Additionally, whenever you would reach 0 integrity, make a test with the assorted bulk die against the mark of 5. On a critical, you remain at 1 integrity. On a success, you remain at 1 integrity and cannot use this special property again until the frame is repaired.

1. Add 3 to the frame's maximum Integrity points. The bulk die is d4.
2. Add 6 to the frame's maximum Integrity points.  The bulk die is d6.
3. Add 9 to the frame's maximum Integrity points.  The bulk die is d8.
