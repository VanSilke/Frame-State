The weapon creates a sort of explosion. The explosion deals the same type of damage as the weapon's primary damage type. If the weapon is melee, the edge of the burst aligns with your hex, so that you are not included, and you can freely rotate the burst around you as long as the initial designation is within it. If the weapon is not melee, the burst's epicentre is in the designation's hex.

1. The burst radius is 1.
2. The burst radius is 3.
