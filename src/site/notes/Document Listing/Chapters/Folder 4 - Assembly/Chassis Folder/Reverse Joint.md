A reverse-joint frame is a highly mobile biped variant, which can jump great distances at the cost of  lesser resilience.
- Whenever the frame moves from a grounded position, it can move vertically up to 20 meters. This still counts as base movement, and not flight.
- The frame ignores the first 20 meters of falling.
