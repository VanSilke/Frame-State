A utility action is one that does not fall under either attack or movement. These can vary, such as surveying the environment, or activating an expansion.


| Action        | Description             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| [[Stabilise\|Stabilise]] | Recover some Stability. |



Currently, the only additional Utility action that does not prevent immediate demise is a mark 5 Smarts action to Survey. A success reveals cloaked units, if any exist within 50 metres. This detection cannot go through solid, non-transparent obstacles.
