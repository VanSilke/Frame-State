A Pilot has three sets of skills to distribute points into.

Each skill involves both the Pilot's frame, and some more personal applications. Most of the activities for using skills with the frame are coded in, and personal use is loosely determined.

Initially, all skills begin as dice of d4, and the Pilot has 7 points to allocate.
